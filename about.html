        <p>Hi! I am a recent graduate at the UCLA Extension's fullstack web development bootcamp. Web development is something I've wanted to gain more exposure in ever since I started my first career in healthcare and technology at a startup company called <a href="https://www.bioiq.com/">BioIQ</a>.</p>
        
        <p>At the time that I joined, BioIQ primarily helped facilitate corporate wellness programs for companies who needed diagnostic testing for preventative conditions like diabetes or cholesterol. We offered a suite of services such as At-Home Test Kits, Lab Visits, On-Site Screenings, etc. and analyzed the data from these screenings on the backend. Not only did this information help companies see the aggregated health of their employee population, but we also worked with insurance companies to help reduce employee insurance premiums if they took action to make their health better.</p> 

        <p>My time at the startup was an invaluable experience: I made great friends, learned so much more than if I had joined an established company, and got to see my character tested day in and day out.</p>

        <p>Now that I have had this informal experience, I know what I want to get more "formal" training in. Subsequently, I took the UCLA Extension's Coding Bootcamp to get more specific training in something that I only had been jerry-rigging at my job doing basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was drawn to the bootcamp because it had the same startup, creative vibe to it that my job had, and it was also tailored to just the practical information one needed to know to get going. Ultimately though I have discovered what I had kind of known even at the beginning but wanted to test anyway: I am more the type of person who works with engineers but isn't necessarily an engineer himself.</p>

        <p>What I mean by this is that I can certainly code, but it just takes me longer than someone who has more of the natural aptitude for that kind of problem-solving, so why should I major in something I am only minorly good at?</p>

        <p>This is why I am returning to my roots of Product Management, Project Management, and Process Management utilized during my startup years. Armed now with more of robust tech background from my programming bootcamp, I think I will be better equipped to re-enter the job market with the skills needed. I should be quick to add that I am also finishing <a href="https://bootcamp.uclaextension.edu/productmanagement/">UCLA's Product Management Bootcamp</a> as well to really get in that 

        
            
            
            
            
            I am excited to learn more about the field and get into development. Here is what I am learning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
            <li>jQuery, Express.js, React.js, Node.js</li>
            <li>Progressive Web Apps, Agile Methodology, Computer Science</li>
            <li>Database Theory, MongoDB, MySQL, Git</li>
            <li>Python, Java, C#</li>
            <li>Amazon Web Services</li>
        </ul>    
        <p>Additionally, while I seek to acquire the skills of a developer, my main goal is to become a better Product Manager. I hope to use my compter science training to be able to communicate better with developers and also estimate the time and resources needed to complete a project.</p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my website!</p>
