        <p>Hi! My name is Nick Johnson and I am a Product Manager with startup experience and technical programming skills. I like creating new value for companies and also resolving pain points, bottlenecks, or inefficiencies that a company might have.</p>

        <p>The startup that I worked at is called <a href="https://www.bioiq.com/">BioIQ</a>. It provided a solid foundation for me for how a company grows and needs to pivot. As it's tenth employee, it was definitely a fun, whirlwind experience to see it expand to 100 employees in only six years and become profitable at that.</p>

        <p>I left BioIQ however because I was itching for some more specific training to focus on instead of the "informal training" that I had been teaching myself and getting from the environment around me. My goal was to get more training in the following, and so far I have completed the first one - "Website Development/Programming":</p>

        <ul class="browser-default disc-list">
            <li>Website Development/Programming</li>
            <li>Product Management</li>
            <li>Project Management</li>
            <li>Process Management</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I should explain that though I have programming skills, I do not consider myself a full-time engineer. Instead, I prefer to use my newly acquired skills to become a better product manager who can more easily create products and work with other engineers in the process. I also consider Product Management as the pinnacle role which then utilizes project and process management to accomplish its goals. Project and process management are life-long skills that I want to constantly iterate on and get better at.</p>

        <p>Aside from work-related things, I have also started learning Mandarin. This too will be a life-long process, but I find Chinese/Taiwanese culture to be very interesting and since I can't roll my "r" in Spanish anyway (but seem to be okay at tones), it's now time to finally be able to speak something besides English ;). I highly recommend by the way the small, personalized, startup language school I found for learning Chinese: <a href="https://www.excelmandarin.com/">Excel Mandarin</a>. Their teachers are amazing, the curriculum is super engaging and self-curated (no textbook), and they create a very cool learning community with other students. Go check 'em out...</p> 
   
        <p>In closing, hopefully this provides a decent snap shot into the range of skills and aptitudes I possess, and what working with me could be like. I appreciate your time in reading my bio and look forward to talking to you soon. Please feel free to contact me by navigating to my website's <a href="contact.html">Contact Page</a> or you can look into my background more by visiting my <a href="resume.html">Resume Page</a>.</p>

        <p>Cheers,</p>

        <p>- Nick</p>
